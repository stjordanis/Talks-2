      <h1>Getting started with Compost</h1>
      <p>
        In this tutorial, we're going to progressively create a chart using Compost. We
        will start with the most basic one and gradually add a number of interesting features.
        This covers most of the core primitives that Compost.js provides for constructing charts.
        There are two things to keep in mind when reading the tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the primitives are quite basic on their own. This is precisely the
        point of the library. You have only a small number of basic primitives, but you can
        easily compose them to build interesting charts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, the primitives are just JavaScript functions that you call from your own
        JavaScript code. Most of the code snippets will look more like declarative specifications
        than like code, but that's just because we are building only basic charts with hard-coded
        data. In a real case, you would generate elements for example using the
        <code>data.map(...)</code> function or using a <code>for</code> loop. Crucially, this
        also means that you can wrap a part of the logic into a reusable function and define
        your own high-level operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final chart that we'll construct in the tutorial shows
        <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Boris_Johnson">Boris
          Johnson's approval rating</a> as of June 2020:

      <script class="compost" type="text/compost">function errorLine(x, y, sdv) {
        return c.strokeColor("black", c.overlay([
          c.line([[[x, 0.5], y-sdv], [[x, 0.5], y+sdv]]),
          c.line([[[x, 0.45], y-sdv], [[x, 0.55], y-sdv]]),
          c.line([[[x, 0.45], y+sdv], [[x, 0.55], y+sdv]])
        ]));
      }

      let chart =
        c.axes("left bottom", c.overlay([
          c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.column("Positive", 39)),
          errorLine("Positive", 39, 7),
          c.fillColor("#D62728", c.column("Negative", 43)),
          errorLine("Negative", 43, 5),
          c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.column("Neutral", 17)),
          errorLine("Neutral", 17, 2)
        ]))

      let legend =
        c.overlay([
          c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.padding(7,0,7,0, c.bar(10, "Positive"))),
          c.fillColor("#D62728", c.padding(7,0,7,0, c.bar(10, "Negative"))),
          c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.padding(7,0,7,0, c.bar(10, "Neutral"))),
          c.font("11pt arial", "black", c.overlay([
            c.text(12, ["Positive",0.5], "Positive", "start"),
            c.text(12, ["Negative",0.5], "Negative", "start"),
            c.text(12, ["Neutral",0.5], "Neutral", "start")
          ]))
        ])

      let demo = c.overlay([
        c.nest(0, 85, 0, 100, chart),
        c.nest(90, 100, 50, 100, legend)
      ])

      c.render("out0", demo)
      </script>
      <div id="out0" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px;margin-top:40px;"></div>

      <h2>Creating and aligning columns</h2>
      <p>Just for fun, let's start with a snippet that defines a single column using
        <code>c.column</code> and then renders it using the <code>c.render</code> function.
        Our column has a categorical X value <code>"Positive"</code> and a continuous
        Y value <code>39</code>. The result is not very impressive:</p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo = c.column("Positive", 39);
c.render("out1a", demo)</code></pre>
      <div id="out1a" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:150px"></div>

      <p>What has happened here? Compost first infers the scales of the chart, which represent
        the range of values that may appear on its axes. For the X axis, the scale is categorical
        containing only one value <code>"Positive"</code>. The scale for the Y axis is continuous
        and contains values form 0 (the bottom of the column) to 39 (the top of the column).
        Compost then projects the single column onto the available space and the single column
        takes the entire available space. It is also drawn using a boring default gray color. </p>
      <p>For the next step, we're going to combine multiple columns. To do this, we use
        <code>c.overlay</code>, which takes a list of chart elements (shapes) and automatically
        aligns them according to the inferred scales:</p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo =
  c.overlay([
    c.column("Positive", 39),
    c.column("Negative", 43),
    c.column("Neutral", 17)
  ])

c.render("out1b", demo)</code></pre>
      <div id="out1b" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:150px"></div>

      <p>This is a bit better! We can see that the X axis has been divided into three
        equally-sized parts. Compost inferred that the X scale now contains three different
        (categorical) values. When rendering a column, it then maps the values onto the
        inferred scale and so each column takes only a part of the space.

      <h2>Adding colors and axes</h2>
      <p>Compost does not (currently) automatically assign colors to different columns.
        They are just shapes that are drawn using a specified color. To change the
        specified color for a part of a chart, we can use <code>c.fillColor</code>, which
        changes color for a shape given as the second parameter. For lines, there is
        <code>c.strokeColor</code>.
      </p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo =
  c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.column("Positive", 39)),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.column("Negative", 43)),
    c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.column("Neutral", 17))
  ])

c.render("out2a", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out2a" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:150px"></div>

      <p>Now we can see that the chart, indeed, consists of three separate columns!
        But how can we find out which one is which? To make this clear, we need to add
        axes. This is done using <code>c.axes</code>, which is a primitive that adds axes
        around a specified (part) of a chart. The first parameter is a string that can contain
        any combination of left/right/top/bottom, depending on what axes we want:
      </p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo =
  c.axes("left bottom", c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.column("Positive", 39)),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.column("Negative", 43)),
    c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.column("Neutral", 17))
  ]))

c.render("out2b", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out2b" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px"></div>
      <p>An important thing to note is that we did not need to tell <code>c.axes</code> what
        the ranges on the axes are. This is inferred automatically. As discussed before,
        Compost infers the scales for both axes (so that it can automatically align shapes)
        and the <code>c.axes</code> primitive just accesses this information.</p>

      <h2>Specifying coordinates</h2>
      <p>So far, our only primitive shape was a column created using <code>c.column</code>.
        This is cheating slightly, because <code>c.column</code> is not actually a primitive;
        it is just a very convenient helper. Under the cover, it uses the <code>c.shape</code>
        primitive, which takes a list of locations and fills a polygon specified by those
        locations.</p>
      <p> A location consists of an X and Y coordinate and we specify them as
        two-element JavaScript arrays. If you have coordinates X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3 and Y3
        and want to fill a triangle specified by those three points, you would specify a list
        of locations as:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-javascript">[ [x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3] ]</code></pre>
      <p>How do we specify a single X or Y coordinate? There are two options, depending on
        whether the scale that we are using is continuous or categorical. For continous scales,
        the coordinate is just a numerical value. If the Y axis has a continous scale representing
        the approval ratings, then Y1 would be just <code>0</code> or <code>39</code>.
      </p>
      <p>For categorical scales, specifying a location is trickier. A categorical value such as
        <code>"Positive"</code> refers to a range rather than a single location, so if we want
        to specify a location, we need to add a numerical value between 0 and 1 that specifies an
        offset within the range. For example, <code>["Positive", 0]</code> is on the very left of
        the range and <code>["Positive", 1]</code> is on the very right.</p>
      <p>To use <code>c.shape</code> to recreate the same column chart as in the previous example,
        we need to give it four locations (representing the four corners of the rectangle), each
        with a categorical X value and a continuous Y value:</p>

<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo =
  c.axes("left bottom", c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.shape([
      [["Positive", 0], 0], [["Positive", 1], 0],
      [["Positive", 1], 39], [["Positive", 0], 39] ])),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.shape([
      [["Negative", 0], 0], [["Negative", 1], 0],
      [["Negative", 1], 43], [["Negative", 0], 43] ]))
  ]))

c.render("out3a", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out3a" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px"></div>

      <p>One nice consequence of how Compost works is that there is no need to distinguish between
        a column chart and a bar chart. Compost actually provides <code>c.column</code> and
        <code>c.bar</code> for convenience, but if we want to turn the previous column chart
        into a bar chart, we just switch the X and Y coordinates in the two lists:
      </p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo =
  c.axes("left bottom", c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.shape([
      [0, ["Positive", 0]], [0, ["Positive", 1]],
      [39, ["Positive", 1]], [39, ["Positive", 0]] ])),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.shape([
      [0, ["Negative", 0]], [0, ["Negative", 1]],
      [43, ["Negative", 1]], [43, ["Negative", 0]] ]))
  ]))

c.render("out3b", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out3b" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px"></div>
      <p>This produces a bar chart as we wanted. It is also worth noting that the axes
        "just work", because they display values according to the inferred scales. Those
        are inferred from the X or Y values that appear in the individual shapes.</p>

      <h2>Combining different shapes</h2>
      <p>Aside from filled polygons, Compost also provides primitives for drawing lines
        and adding text. Lines are obviously useful if you want to create a line chart,
        but there is nothing preventing you from combining multiple different shapes in
        a single chart. </p>
      <p>You might not be used to think about charts in this way, but there is a number
        of nice use cases. For example, what if we wanted to add an error bar to our bar
        chart? This is just a line in the middle of the bar. </p>
      <p>A line is specified in the same way as a shape, i.e. as a list of locations that
        consist of X and Y coordinates. Let's say that we want to display a bar chart with
        values 39+/-7 and 43+/-5 (those are made up numbers, not actual standard deviation
        of the approval ratings):</p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo =
  c.axes("left bottom", c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.shape([
      [["Positive", 0], 0], [["Positive", 1], 0],
      [["Positive", 1], 39], [["Positive", 0], 39] ])),
    c.strokeColor("black", c.line([
      [["Positive", 0.5], 32], [["Positive", 0.5], 46] ])),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.shape([
      [["Negative", 0], 0], [["Negative", 1], 0],
      [["Negative", 1], 43], [["Negative", 0], 43] ])),
    c.strokeColor("black", c.line([
      [["Negative", 0.5], 38], [["Negative", 0.5], 48] ])),
  ]))

c.render("out4a", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out4a" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px"></div>
      <p>This works fine, but it is not exactly great. The lines would look nicer if
        they also had smaller horizontal lines at the bottom and at the top. The code is also
        becoming quite long and would get much longer with more than two columns.</p>
      <p>Wouldn't it be nicer if you just had a built-in primitive for error bars?
        The nice thing about Compost is that this is pretty much exactly what we can do
        on our own! Just like there is <code>c.column</code> helper, we can define our own
        helper <code>errorLine</code> for creating error bars. This is just a JavaScript
        function that takes the X and Y values together with a standard deviation for the bar:</p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">function errorLine(x, y, sdv) {
  return c.strokeColor("black", c.overlay([
    c.line([[[x, 0.5], y-sdv], [[x, 0.5], y+sdv]]),
    c.line([[[x, 0.45], y-sdv], [[x, 0.55], y-sdv]]),
    c.line([[[x, 0.45], y+sdv], [[x, 0.55], y+sdv]])
  ]));
}

let demo =
  c.axes("left bottom", c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.column("Positive", 39)),
    errorLine("Positive", 39, 7),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.column("Negative", 43)),
    errorLine("Negative", 43, 5),
    c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.column("Neutral", 17)),
    errorLine("Neutral", 17, 2)
  ]))

c.render("out4b", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out4b" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px"></div>
      <p>Once we define the <code>errorLine</code> function, the rest of the code to create the
        chart is very succinct and clear. Of course, we had to define the helper function, but
        this is something that you only need to do once.</p>

      <h2>Overriding inferred scales</h2>
      <p>In all the previous examples, the scales were inferred automatically. In some cases,
        it is useful to be able to override the inferred scale and specify your own. For example,
        let's say that we want the range displayed on the Y axis to be from 0 to 100. We can
        do this using the <code>c.scaleY</code> operation. The first argument of this operation
        is a scale, which can be created using the <code>s.continuous</code> function:</p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo =
  c.axes("left bottom", c.scaleY(s.continuous(0, 100), c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.column("Positive", 39)),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.column("Negative", 43)),
    c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.column("Neutral", 17))
  ])))

c.render("out5", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out5" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px"></div>
      <p>Here, we create a continuous scale using <code>s.continuous</code>, which takes the
        smallest and the largest values as arguments. You can also explicitly create categorical
        scales using <code>s.categorical</code>. In this case, you need to provide an array of
        strings representing the individual categories. This may be useful if you want to add
        a category for which you don't have data, or if you want to explicitly specify their order.</p>

      <h2>Combining different charts and more</h2>
      <p>So far, we've seen how to combine multiple shapes using <code>c.overlay</code>. This
        is, in fact, the only way to combine multiple shapes. However, there is much more we can
        do using this primitive if we combine it with a "nesting" operation that lets us
        create a new virtual space with its own scales within a larger chart.</p>

      <p>To demonstrate nesting, we're going to add a legend to the right side of our bar
        chart. There is no built-in primitive for legends in Compost, but we can create one
        just by overlaying three bars (shapes) of the same size and three labels created using
        <code>c.text</code>:</p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">let demo =
  c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.padding(10,0,10,0, c.bar(10, "Positive"))),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.padding(10,0,10,0, c.bar(10, "Negative"))),
    c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.padding(10,0,10,0, c.bar(10, "Neutral"))),
    c.font("11pt arial", "black", c.overlay([
      c.text(12, ["Positive",0.5], "Positive", "start"),
      c.text(12, ["Negative",0.5], "Negative", "start"),
      c.text(12, ["Neutral",0.5], "Neutral", "start")
    ]))
  ])

c.render("out6a", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out6a" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px"></div>
      <p>There are three new primitives in this snippet. First, we use <code>c.padding</code>
        to add a space around the bar. This takes a padding that should be added from the
        top, right, bottom and the left side (the order is the same as in CSS). Second,
        we use <code>c.text</code> to add a label. This takes the X and Y coordinates,
        followed by the label and a location with respect to the x, Y location. You can use
        baseline, hanging or middle for vertical alignment and start, end or center for
        horizontal alignment. Finally, we also specify font and text color using <code>c.font</code>.

      <p>If you imagine the above chart as being much smaller, then it looks like a chart
        legend. There is one last thing that we need to do, which is to put everything we've
        done together. The following snippet (re)defines the <code>errorLine</code> helper,
        defines a <code>legend</code> shape from the previous code sample and creates a chart
        <code>chart</code>. It then combines <code>legend</code> with <code>chart</code> into
        a single chart that is rendered. We discuss how this is done below:</p>
<pre class="compost"><code class="lang-javascript">function errorLine(x, y, sdv) {
  return c.strokeColor("black", c.overlay([
    c.line([[[x, 0.5], y-sdv], [[x, 0.5], y+sdv]]),
    c.line([[[x, 0.45], y-sdv], [[x, 0.55], y-sdv]]),
    c.line([[[x, 0.45], y+sdv], [[x, 0.55], y+sdv]])
  ]));
}

let legend =
  c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.padding(7,0,7,0, c.bar(10, "Positive"))),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.padding(7,0,7,0, c.bar(10, "Negative"))),
    c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.padding(7,0,7,0, c.bar(10, "Neutral"))),
    c.font("11pt arial", "black", c.overlay([
      c.text(12, ["Positive",0.5], "Positive", "start"),
      c.text(12, ["Negative",0.5], "Negative", "start"),
      c.text(12, ["Neutral",0.5], "Neutral", "start")
    ]))
  ])

let chart =
  c.axes("left bottom", c.scaleY(s.continuous(0, 55), c.overlay([
    c.fillColor("#2CA02C", c.column("Positive", 39)),
    errorLine("Positive", 39, 7),
    c.fillColor("#D62728", c.column("Negative", 43)),
    errorLine("Negative", 43, 5),
    c.fillColor("#1F77B4", c.column("Neutral", 17)),
    errorLine("Neutral", 17, 2)
  ])))

let demo = c.overlay([
  c.nest(0, 85, 0, 100, chart),
  c.nest(90, 100, 50, 100, legend)
])
c.render("out6b", demo)
</code></pre>
      <div id="out6b" class="compost-out" style="max-width:500px;height:200px"></div>
      <p>In order to put the legend on the right side of the chart, we use the
        <code>c.nest</code> operation and then overlay the results. The nest operation
        takes two locations (X1, X2, Y1, Y2) and draws the shape it gets as the last argument
        inside a rectangle specified by those two points. The scales inside the shape can be
        completely different from the scales on the outside.</p>
      <p>In our example, both shapes that we
        combine are constructed using <code>c.nest</code> and the scale on the outside is
        thus defined only by the locations given to <code>c.nest</code>.
        The X and Y values for the rectangle containing the main chart are 0 to 85 (for X)
        and 0 to 100 (for Y). For the legend, those are 90 to 100 (for X) and 0 to 50 (for Y).
        This means that we're dedicating 85% of the horizontal space for the main chart,
        followed by 5% gap and 10% for the legend. Vertically, the legend only occupies the top
        half of the space. Note that our choice of numbers from 0 to 100 is arbitrary. This is
        just an (automatically inferred) continuous scale, so the code would work equally well
        with values between 0 and 1.</p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>To summarize, the tutorial shows the two key features of Compost:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small number of primitives.</strong>
          There is only a small number of primitives, but they can be composed to create
          rich charts. In our example, we composed filled shapes to create columns (and bars)
          with lines to add error bars to our chart.</li>
        <li><strong>Domain-specific coordinates.</strong>
          The composition is made easy thanks to the fact that we specify all coordinates in
          terms of domain values. Those can be continuous (just a number) or categorical
          (a category name with a number indicating a location within a range allocated for
          the category).</li>
        <li><strong>High-level abstractions.</strong>
          You can use standard JavaScript functions to define high-level chart abstractions.
          In our example, we defined a function <code>errorLine</code> to draw an error bar
          for a bar chart. Similarly, we could define one to add a legend or a title
          or to create a particular chart such as pairplot. </li>
      </ul>
